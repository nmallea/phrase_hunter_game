### Programming Language Guessing Game
A browser-based, word game using vanilla JavaScript and OOP. 

-------

Each time the player guesses a letter, the app compares the letter the player has chosen with the random word or phrase. If the letter is in the word, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the word/phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once.
